This will be a simple calories etc program for beverages in german language.


How to use
----------

This Python-3-Program requires Kivy on a Desktop OS.

In mid-2020, the Kivy installation did not work with Python 3.8 on Windows,
so I used Python 3.7.

The Kivy installation is linked here:
https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html
There select your Operating System, and you see how to
"Install the kivy stable release".
